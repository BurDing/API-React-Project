## Grading Breakdown

Lorem Ipsem

## Rules
1. This is an individual assignment. No collaboration is permitted.
2. It is not permitted to copy/paste code that is not your own. You are, however, free to look at different code sources for inspiration and clarity. All sources (code as well as reading material) that you reference to complete this assignment must be declared in the submission.
3. There should be no use of inline styling.
4. No inline script tags should be used.
5. HTML tables cannot be used for layout.
6. If you think something youâ€™re doing might not be acceptable, please ask on Piazza.
7. You must utilize some SCSS features (variables, mixins, etc). A plain CSS file will receive less points.

## Environment Setup Guide
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp2_starter_17.git mp2`, then `cd mp1`
2. Install dependencies:
`npm install`
3. Run the dev server:
`npm run dev`
4. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/` to view your page. You should see "Welcome to MP2!".
5. Open up `source/index.js` and `source/html/index.html` and read the comments in those files to get an idea of how to start. *We will not answer questions that are already answered by the comments there.*
